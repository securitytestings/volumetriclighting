# volumetriclighting
A module for Volumetric Lighting on ROBLOX. Includes heavy optimisation, and multiple options for higher performance.

Forked from a plugin by NOPESbucket, heavily optimised with new features. 
ParallelScheduler is not included, it can be found in the ROBLOX marketplace. A new ParallelScheduler will be custom written by me in the near future.

May include bugs. I'm updating it as much as possible.

Has been tested on mobile and PC. Console may be supported but untested, im unsure about VR.
